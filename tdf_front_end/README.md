# TWITTER DUMPSTER FIRE DOT COMMIE
## Right ? Must be a commie if you don't bow down to tiny hands.

Anyway this site is developed using react, styled-components and chartjs and is my first foray into styled-components and chartjs.
All of the react components are functional components using hooks for lifecycle events.

I pull in a daily dump of tweets from @realdonaldtrump and compare the text of the tweet or retweek with a list of words that rank the sentiment. 

Speaking of the backend. The server is hosted on an ubuntu linux droplet running nodejs and using express for the routing. I use the sentiment npm module to do the sentiment ranking on the nodejs backend.
